# The cpsv-ap_xborderChatbotPilot_EpirusBelgium
The pilot activities around a chatbot resulted from two questions for which hypothesis were set up:

•	CPSV-AP can be used to develop chatbots as a way to structure the information about the public services; and

•	CPSV-AP contains enough data to provide a user with key information about the public services.

For answering those two hypothesis, a pilot was conducted with the Belgian Federal Public Service for policy and support (BOSA) and the region of Epirus (Greece). However, as the data collected for the pilot was limited in terms of quantity of information available for each public service, we decided also to prepare a demo about one public service fully described with CPSV-AP. The objective of this demo was to demonstrate whether the second hypothesis was true or not.
